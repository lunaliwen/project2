NoWait is a node application that allows a user to make a reservation at a restaurant by entering their contact information into a form. After creating a reservation, they are given a reservation number.  Once at the restaurant, the party will enter their reservation number gain to access the Menu. From  some electronic device at their table the party can choose options from the menu, submit them to the kitchen and even view their bill without ever needing a waiter.
